	<h3 align="center"><strong>This will make your blood boil: Republican health care bill doesn't eliminate Obamacare</strong></h3>
	<p>House GOP lawmakers have finally passed a bill aimed at repealing Obamacare ... or major portions of it.</p>
	
<p>Leaders from the conservative and moderate wings of the Republican Party made several changes in recent weeks to drum up more support for the legislation, which was shelved in late March after failing to get enough votes to pass. The bill now moves to the Senate, which will likely make substantial revisions.</p>

<p>The original bill, called the American Health Care Act, had a lot of critics -- ranging from conservative lawmakers to moderate ones to insurers to the AARP.</p>

<p>Conservatives complained that the bill does not fully repeal Obamacare and that many provisions are too similar to the health reform law. Insurers worried that Republicans would cut federal support for Medicaid and tax credits, leaving many of their customers without coverage.</p>

<p>And the AARP feared that Americans in their 50s and early 60s would see their premiums skyrocket and federal assistance reduced, though lawmakers are now promising to provide this group extra assistance.
Proponents of the bill said it would save the individual health market from collapse. The legislation would create a patient-centered health care system that provides Americans more choice, greater control and lower costs, they argued.</p>

<p>But opponents said it could reverse the gains in coverage that have been made since the Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010. The Congressional Budget Office found that 24 million fewer people would be insured by 2026 under the GOP bill. The CBO estimates do not include the most recent amendment to the bill, however.</p>
