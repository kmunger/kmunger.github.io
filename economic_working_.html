<p>The US economy seems back on track after a brutal set of hurricanes—employers added 261,000 jobs in October and the unemployment rate edged down to 4.1%.</p>

<p>While markets had expected a whopping 310,000 new jobs to replace the ones temporarily lost because of the hurricanes, the news is still good: Unemployment is now at its lowest since 2000, and job creation has edged up in stronger fashion.</p>

<p>Still, the overall results are mixed. The labor force participation rate—which measures how many people are actively looking for jobs—fell. And the number of workers relative to the population as a whole also fell.</p>

<p>What’s most concerning is that while jobs are plentiful, what people are actually getting paid has hardly grown.</p>

<p>Average hourly earnings for private workers have barely budged, growing just 2.4% in October from a year earlier. (This partially reflects the automatic fall in average wages from the previous month because of the return of workers in low-paid sectors temporarily kept from their jobs by hurricanes.) For production and nonsupervisory private workers (i.e. non-managers) annual hourly wage growth adjusted for inflation was 0.1% in October.</p>

<p>Inflation-adjusted wage growth has also been lower during 2017 than in recent years. (To be fair, real wage growth at the start of Obama’s term was so high because inflation had virtually disappeared.)</p>

<p>Now, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve, and whether the Federal Open Market Committee will raise rates come December. Despite dismal wage growth for the average American, traders still believe a rate hike is imminent: Fed funds futures, as of November 3, still indicate a 90% chance of a December raise.</p>
