<p>As team captains, LeBron James and Steph Curry got to pick their teams for the 2018 NBA All-Star Game. This is the first time the league is using this format.</p>

<p>While there were five starters picked from the West and East, and seven reserves picked from each conference, when it came to the draft, the conferences didn’t matter. They first chose from the group of eight starters, then the reserve pool after that.</p>

<p>Here’s how it turned out:</p>

<p>The Team LeBron starters are Kevin Durant, Anthony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins and Kyrie Irving.</p>

<p>Coming off the bench is Bradley Beal, LaMarcus Aldridge, Kevin Love, Russell Westbrook, Victor Oladipo, Kristaps Porzingis and John Wall.</p>

<p>The Team Steph starters are James Harden, DeMar DeRozan, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid.</p>

<p>Coming off the bench is Damian Lillard, Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green, Kyle Lowry, Klay Thompson, Karl-Anthony Towns and Al Horford.</p>
